Problem to solve:
Which strategy 2 riders should follow to visit 4 citites in minimal time?
All of them begin their way from one special city. Let's call it capital

I think, there are two important questions:
1. What's a minimal time.
2. Which way gets minimal time?

Let's at first answer the first question, and then try to make solution a little bit bigger.

Now: only minTime.
